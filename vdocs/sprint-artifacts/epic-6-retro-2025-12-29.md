## Epic Summary

**Goal:** Enable passive activity tracking that enhances AI context with behavioral inference.

**Delivery Metrics:**
- **Completed Stories:** 5/5 (100%)
- **Story Breakdown:**
  - 6-1: Window Title Tracking (X11) ✅
  - 6-2: Window Title Tracking (Wayland GNOME) ✅
  - 6-3: File Modification Tracking ✅
  - 6-4: Context Aggregator ✅
  - 6-5: Privacy Controls ✅
- **Duration:** ~5 days (2025-12-24 to 2025-12-28)
- **Models Used:** Gemini 2.0 Flash (3 stories), Claude 3.7 Sonnet (1 story)

**Quality Metrics:**
- Code review issues caught: 20+ across all stories
- Test growth: 145 → 212 backend tests (+67)
- Frontend tests: 246+
- Production incidents: 0

**Technical Achievements:**
- ✅ Daemon-based observer architecture (separate process via Unix socket)
- ✅ Multi-backend pattern (X11 + Wayland abstraction)
- ✅ Bidirectional IPC for live settings sync
- ✅ Forward Context Linking algorithm for AI tool attribution
- ✅ Privacy controls with regex-based exclusions

**Known Limitation:**
- Wayland window tracking requires GNOME Shell Extension (not yet created)
- Observer is documented but awaiting extension implementation

---

## What Went Well

### 1. Daemon Architecture Proved Stable
- Separate `ronin-observer` binary via Unix socket
- Clean process lifecycle management
- No crashes or stability issues

### 2. Multi-Backend Pattern Scaled
- X11 backend (x11rb-async)
- Wayland backend (zbus/D-Bus)
- Shared types module eliminated duplication
- Easy to extend for future platforms

### 3. Senior Dev Review Continued Effectiveness
- All 5 stories had code review
- 20+ issues caught before merge
- Pattern from Epic 5 retro successfully applied

### 4. Forward Context Linking Innovation
- Novel algorithm to attribute AI tool windows to projects
- Looks ahead 5 window switches to find project context
- Solves the "Claude window has no project" problem

### 5. Privacy-First Design
- 義 (Gi) principle: excluded data NEVER logged
- Regex-based URL/domain exclusions
- Data viewer and delete-all functionality

---

## Challenges & Growth Areas

### 1. Wayland Shell Extension Gap
**Issue:** Story 6.2 architecture is ready, but actual GNOME Shell Extension not created.

**Impact:** Wayland users see "Extension Required" message but can't actually track windows.

**Lesson:** Should have scoped extension creation OR explicitly marked it out-of-scope with tracking issue.

### 2. Integration Tests Incomplete
**Issue:** Story 6.5 has unchecked manual test cases and missing integration tests.

**Status:** Unit tests pass, but end-to-end verification incomplete.

### 3. OS Limitation Reality
**Issue:** Ronin is Linux-only. GitHub releases exist but no downloads.

**Root Cause:** Target audience (developers) largely on macOS/Windows.

## Epic 5 Action Item Follow-Through

| Action Item | Owner | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| Document Serde/TypeScript Pattern | Charlie | ⏳ Not verified |
| Continue Senior Dev Review Pattern | Team | ✅ Applied (all 5 stories) |
| Add manual testing after code review | Team | ⏳ Partially (tests documented, not executed) |

**Follow-Through Rate:** 1/2 applicable items (50%)

## 🚨 SIGNIFICANT DISCOVERY: Strategic Pivot Required

### The Core Problem

During retrospective discussion, V (Project Lead) surfaced a fundamental insight:

> "Without reasoning and comprehensive knowledge of abandoned projects, AI can't give any context of 'where we left'. It's doing good when the project is still active and under development. But when it's going to be a dormant project, scanning git commits only is not helpful at all."

### Analysis

**Original Ronin Promise:** "Pick up abandoned projects like you never left"

**Reality Check:**
- ✅ Git history - Available but shallow ("what changed")
- ✅ DEVLOG - Great if written, but manual
- ✅ Observer data - Recent behavior, stale after dormancy
- ❌ **Reasoning capture** - Why were you doing what you were doing?
- ❌ **Decision context** - What options did you consider and reject?
- ❌ **"Where I was headed"** - Intent, not just history

### Epic 4.5 Post-Mortem

Epic 4.5 (Reasoning Infrastructure) was deferred due to multiple failures:

1. **Technical Mismatch:** Vercel AI SDK (JavaScript) called via Rust reqwest - fundamentally incompatible
2. **Planning Failure:** Rushed into stories without understanding the problem
3. **Wrong Research:** Researched solution (SDK integration) not problem (reasoning capture)
4. **Misframed Stories:** "Persona migration" instead of "reasoning capture for dormancy"

**Root Cause:** Did not study how BMAD method actually works before trying to automate it.

### Strategic Redirect

**Epic 7 (System Polish): DEFERRED**
- System tray, notifications, settings polish
- Premature for Linux-only app with no users
- Polish on incomplete core functionality

**New Priority: Research BMAD Brownfield Methodology**
- Study `_bmad/` folder to understand how BMAD captures project context
- Learn how brownfield method documents existing codebases
- Understand what makes dormant projects recoverable
- Design Ronin's reasoning capture based on actual understanding

---

## Action Items

### Critical Path (Before Any New Development)

1. **Research BMAD Brownfield Method**
   - Owner: V (Project Lead)
   - Action: Deep dive into `_bmad/` folder, specifically brownfield workflows
   - Goal: Understand how BMAD captures and recovers project context
   - Deadline: Before any new epic planning

2. **Redesign Epic 4.5 Based on Research**
   - Owner: Team
   - Action: Create new epic definition based on BMAD learning
   - Goal: Proper problem understanding before implementation
   - Deadline: After research complete

### Deferred

- **Epic 7 (System Polish):** Deferred until core value proposition is built
- **GNOME Shell Extension:** Deferred (Wayland tracking incomplete)

### Technical Debt

- Story 6.5 integration tests incomplete
- Story 6.2 Wayland extension not created

---

## Key Insights & Lessons Learned

### 1. Infrastructure Without Purpose
We built 6 epics of solid infrastructure (Tauri, SQLite, Git ops, Observer) but the *core differentiator* - reasoning capture for dormant projects - was never properly designed or built.

### 2. Understanding Before Building
Epic 4.5 failed because we rushed to implementation. The fix isn't "try again harder" - it's "understand the problem first."

### 3. Platform Reality Check
Linux-only is a significant limitation. Cross-platform should be considered, but only after core value is proven.

### 4. BMAD as Source of Truth
The answer to "how do you capture reasoning" might already exist in BMAD methodology. Study it before reinventing.

## Retrospective Closure

**Epic 6: Silent Observer & AI Integration** - Complete and successful from a delivery perspective.

**Strategic Status:** Pivot required. Core value proposition (dormant project recovery) is unbuilt.

**Next Steps:**
1. Research BMAD brownfield methodology in `_bmad/`
2. Understand how project context is captured and recovered
3. Redesign reasoning capture feature based on actual understanding
4. Only then proceed with implementation

**Team Performance:**
Epic 6 delivered 5 stories with 100% completion. Technical execution was strong. The retrospective surfaced a critical strategic insight that redirects the project toward its actual value proposition.
