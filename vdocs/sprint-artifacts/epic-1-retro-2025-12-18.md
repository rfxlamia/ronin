## What Went Well

### 1. Comprehensive Documentation
- 2,000+ lines of specifications (Architecture, UX, PRD)
- Clear acceptance criteria with no ambiguity
- "Previous Story Intelligence" sections provided valuable context

### 2. Thorough Code Review Process
- Every story had at least one review cycle
- Story 1.3: 7 issues identified and fixed
- Story 1.4: Multiple review cycles with fixes applied
- Quality control working effectively

### 3. Solid Test Coverage
- Story 1.3: 10 unit tests covering database functionality
- Story 1.4: 14 tests covering components and accessibility
- Database integrity checks caught potential issues early

### 4. Clear Story Structure
- Comprehensive story files with technical context
- Dev Notes sections provided architecture alignment
- Previous learnings documented for continuity

### 5. Foundation Quality
- No regressions introduced
- All tests passing
- Technical stack validated: Tauri v2 + React 19.2.3 + TypeScript + Rust

---

## Challenges & Growth Areas

### 1. Dependency Management
- **Issue:** React 19 peer dependency conflicts with shadcn/ui
- **Resolution:** Used `--force` flag, documented workaround
- **Learning:** Dependency conflicts require vigilance, especially with React 19

### 2. Asset Generation Workflow
- **Issue:** Undefined workflow caused inconsistency (PNG → SVG regeneration in Story 1.4)
- **Root Cause:** No clear protocol for asset generation during development
- **Resolution:** New protocol defined (placeholders → /generateimage workflow)

### 3. Code Review Cycles
- **Issue:** Multiple review cycles added time
- **Perspective:** Better than shipping broken code - quality over speed
- **Outcome:** Prevented regressions, improved code quality

### 4. Security Awareness
- **Issue:** Concern about React 19 RCE vulnerability (CVSS 10.0)
- **Resolution:** Verified React 19.2.3 is safe (vulnerability affected 19.0.0-19.2.0 only)
- **Learning:** Security monitoring is critical, code-review workflow includes security analysis

---

## Key Insights

### 1. Quality Over Speed
Multiple review cycles prevented shipping broken code. The time investment in reviews paid off in zero regressions.

### 2. Process Clarity Matters
Undefined asset workflow caused inconsistency. Clear protocols prevent confusion and maintain velocity.

### 3. Foundation is Solid
Epic 1 delivered exactly what Epic 2 needs. All dependencies complete, no blockers.

### 4. Security Vigilance Required
Dependency vulnerabilities require ongoing monitoring. React 19.2.3 verified safe, but awareness is critical.

### 5. Documentation Drives Success
2,000+ lines of specs provided clarity. Comprehensive story files enabled efficient implementation.

## Action Items Implemented (During Retrospective)

All action items were implemented immediately before closing Epic 1 to ensure they're not forgotten:

### ✅ AI-1: Update dev-story Workflow
- **Owner:** Bob (Scrum Master)
- **Task:** Modified workflow instructions to explicitly read "Manual Test Notes" section
- **Status:** COMPLETE - Updated `_bmad/bmm/workflows/4-implementation/dev-story/instructions.xml`

### ✅ AI-2: Define Placeholder CSS Standard
- **Owner:** Charlie (Senior Dev)
- **Task:** Added `.ronin-placeholder` class to `src/index.css`
- **Status:** COMPLETE - Dashed Antique Brass border with striped background

### ✅ AI-3: Implement Asset Generation Protocol
- **Owner:** Dev Agent (protocol update)
- **Task:** Documented protocol: Build logic → Placeholders → Ask "Run /generateimage?" → Execute pipeline
- **Status:** COMPLETE - Documented in `docs/project-context.md`

### ✅ AI-4: Add Manual Test Notes Template
- **Owner:** Dana (QA Engineer)
- **Task:** Documented Manual Test Notes template for Product Lead verification
- **Status:** COMPLETE - Template in `docs/project-context.md`

### ✅ AI-5: Regression Test Protocol
- **Owner:** Dana (QA Engineer)
- **Task:** Before marking any story done, verify all previous epic tests still pass
- **Status:** COMPLETE - Protocol documented in `docs/project-context.md`

### ✅ AI-6: Document React Version
- **Owner:** Charlie (Senior Dev)
- **Task:** Documented React 19.2.3 with security verification
- **Status:** COMPLETE - Added to `docs/project-context.md` with security note
