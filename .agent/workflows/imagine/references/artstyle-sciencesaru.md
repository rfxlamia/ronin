# Science SARU Visual Style Guide for AI Generation

## Studio Philosophy: Balancing Science and Intuition

Science SARU's name encapsulates their approach: **"Science" represents logic, technology, and planning; "SARU" (monkey) embodies creativity, instinct, and playfulness**. Founded in 2013 by director Masaaki Yuasa and producer Eunyoung Choi, the studio revolutionized Japanese animation through "digitally assisted animation"—hand-drawn key frames digitally recreated for in-betweening. This hybrid method enables small teams to produce fluid, expressive work that prioritizes emotional truth over photorealism.

The studio's artistic mission: **take creatively fulfilling challenges that forge new pathways in animation**. They reject fitting into any single category, embracing experimental approaches while maintaining accessibility. Their visual philosophy centers on expressiveness over accuracy, with Yuasa stating "animation should not imitate reality but interpret, exaggerate, or transcend it." This creates the perfect aesthetic for social realism meets artistic expression.

## Core Visual DNA: Technical Characteristics

### Linework Signature

Science SARU's linework deliberately rejects polished perfection. **Loose, organic, variable-thickness lines with sketchy, rough quality** define their aesthetic. Lines breathe and fluctuate with movement, preserving animator personality even through digital processing. While Flash vectorization sometimes creates "unnaturally clean sequences," the studio maintains raw, expressive mark-making where possible.

**For AI prompts**: "loose hand-drawn linework, rough sketchy lines, variable line weight, organic imperfect contours, expressive mark-making, anti-polished aesthetic, visible pencil texture, breathing lines that fluctuate with movement"

### Character Design Principles

Characters feature **simplified, minimalist designs optimized for fluid movement** rather than static beauty. The philosophy: reduce line count to enable characters to move twice as much. Bodies exhibit jelly-limbed elasticity with soft, rounded contours and moderate stylization—grounded enough for emotional connection yet flexible enough for dramatic distortion.

Facial expressions embrace extreme warping—faces stretch, dislocate, and balloon beyond anatomical limits. Blank eyes convey possession or emptiness, while grotesquely beautiful expressions oppose pristine anime standards. This rubber-band movement vocabulary allows bodies to warp with internal emotional states.

**For AI prompts**: "simplified character designs, elastic limbs, moderate stylization, personality-driven designs, minimalist features optimized for animation, jelly-limbed anatomy, soft rounded contours, rubber-band facial expressions, off-model expressiveness for emotion"

### Animation Movement Characteristics

Science SARU achieves **extreme fluidity through Western squash-and-stretch principles rarely used in anime**. Bodies perpetually deform during motion with sinewy, elastic movement. Heavy smear frames create speed effects, while super-deformed in-betweens smooth transitions. The "Devilman Dash"—animalistic four-legged running with hunched posture—exemplifies their kinetic energy.

Camera work stays **extremely dynamic**, with tracking shots that dip, slide, and rise with character action. Perspective-following motion creates dizzying transportive effects. The camera matches character energy, rarely remaining static.

**For AI prompts**: "extreme motion fluidity, bend-and-stretch animation, kinetic sinewy movement, elastic body distortion, heavy smear frames, perpetually deforming motion, dynamic tracking camera matching character movement, smooth sliding ground-level camera, watercolor-flow movement"

## Color Theory and Atmospheric Mastery

### Palette Philosophy

Science SARU employs **flat tints of bold primary colors with limited but impactful palettes**. Rather than gradual realistic shading, they use color blocking with complementary schemes (red/green, blue/orange) for visual contrast. The approach varies dramatically by project tone—high saturation for energetic works, desaturated muted tones for historical or melancholic pieces.

**Temperature coding**: Warm tones signal love, passion, and energy. Cool tones convey conflict, uncertainty, and melancholy. Strategic shifts between color temperatures mark emotional beats.

### Lighting Approaches: Stylized Over Realistic

Lighting prioritizes **dramatic stylization supporting emotional atmosphere**. Deep shadows with stark highlights create high contrast in intense scenes. Naoko Yamada's works add simulated cinematic artifacts—bloom lighting, chromatic aberration on close-ups, light leaks foreshadowing narrative events.

Golden hour/sunset lighting features warm orange-pink gradients with long shadows and backlit silhouettes. These moments aren't photorealistic but use **exaggerated warm tones and simplified shadow shapes** maintaining design coherence while creating nostalgic atmosphere.

**For AI prompts**: "dramatic stylized lighting with deep shadows, bloom lighting effects, warm golden hour gradients, backlit silhouettes, long cast shadows with warm color, nostalgic atmosphere through lighting, simplified shadow shapes"

### Shadow and Texture Treatment

Shadows aren't strictly black—they incorporate **cool tones (blues, purples) for depth or warm tones for sunset scenes**. Complementary colors to the main palette add visual richness. Contrast levels vary: high contrast for supernatural drama (Devilman Crybaby), medium for action pieces, low contrast for elegant historical works (The Heike Story).

Texture comes through **painterly touches rather than film grain**. Inky scroll-painting textures, watercolor rendering, and paper-like surfaces (chiyogami influences) create organic quality. Digital illustration techniques layer gradients and texture mapping while maintaining intentionally "unfinished" aesthetics with irregular geometric shapes reminiscent of collages.

**For AI prompts**: "painterly watercolor texture, inky scroll-painting aesthetic, paper texture overlays, complementary shadow colors, irregular geometric shapes with crafted dimension, deliberately unfinished texture with thick irregular lines"

## Background Art: Environmental Storytelling

### Urban Street Scene Mastery

Science SARU excels at **dense, lived-in urban environments with layered architectural complexity**. Their "phobia of gaps" philosophy creates compositions chockful of information—overlapping buildings, signage, cables, and street furniture. Vibrant saturated palettes convey urban energy while maintaining readability through strategic composition.

Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken! demonstrates their urban approach: industrial-meets-residential aesthetic, water and canal prominence, mechanical details integrated into the fabric, multi-ethnic visual indicators, and retro-futuristic textures.

**For Indonesian urban streets, Science SARU style would feature**:

**Technical foundation**: Vector-based Adobe Animate with digital painting overlays, flat bold color blocking with gradient transitions, clean linework defining architectural edges, layered composition for parallax depth effects, two-point perspective with dynamic camera capability.

**Visual aesthetic**: Dense information-packed frames avoiding negative space, vibrant saturated tropical palette (warm oranges, yellows, deep greens), simplified geometric architecture with textural overlays, atmospheric haze suggesting heat and humidity, strong light/shadow contrast from tropical sun, wet-surface reflections and puddles, stylized weathering on buildings.

**Environmental elements**: Vertical layering (multi-story shophouses, hanging laundry, signage), street-level density (motorcycles, vendors, pedestrians), tropical vegetation integration (palms, vines, potted plants), prominent infrastructure (power lines, cables, water pipes), cultural specificity (warungs, religious elements, local signage), mixed architectural styles (colonial/modern/informal), mechanical details (motorcycles, generators, fans).

**For AI prompts**: "Dense layered urban composition, overlapping architectural elements and signage, vibrant warm tropical color palette with saturated oranges and yellows, simplified geometric architecture, atmospheric heat haze in distance, strong tropical sunlight creating dramatic shadows, wet reflective surfaces, multi-story shophouses with vertical emphasis, street-level motorcycles and vendors, hanging power lines and cables prominent, tropical palm trees and vegetation, mixed colonial and modern architecture, simplified architectural detail with textural weathering overlays"

### Background Painting Techniques

Backgrounds use **digital-watercolor hybrid aesthetic with flat, stylized color blocking**. Mid-tone key colors establish foundation, then light and dark layers build on top. Photoshop workflow employs complementary and analogous color schemes with blending modes (multiply, overlay, screen) for depth.

Detail hierarchy: foreground receives high detail with clear textures and readable signage; midground shows moderate detail with clear architectural features; background simplifies to suggested forms with atmospheric fading. This prevents backgrounds from competing with character focus.

**For AI prompts**: "Flat stylized background painting, digital watercolor aesthetic, mid-tone key color with built-up light layers, simplified geometric forms, strategic detail hierarchy with sharp foreground and atmospheric faded background, color gradient mesh for smooth tonal transitions"

## Emotional Scene Treatment: Melancholy and Social Themes

### Visualizing Poverty and Isolation

Science SARU handles heavy emotional themes through **contrast between mundane reality and transcendent moments**. The Heike Story demonstrates melancholic mastery with desaturated inky scroll-painting hues, visual poetry using pillow shots, and nature metaphors for offscreen tragedy. Colors convey Buddhist impermanence—muted elegance suggests restraint and dignity in suffering.

Devilman Crybaby shows how **vibrant colors make tragic moments more heartbreaking through contrast**. Dark moody bases with occasional pops of vibrant color create oppressive atmosphere punctuated by intensity. The apocalypse sequence features deep blue night sky tapering to baby blue at ocean's edge with glittering white spots—finding beauty in horror.

For poverty themes specifically: **desaturation lowers emotional temperature** (sadness, loss, distance), cool color dominance (blues, cool grays, muted purples) suggests introspection, limited palettes create oppressive feeling, soft gradients reflect emotional gentleness, muted earth tones connect to impermanence and decay.

### Social Realism Meets Artistic Expression

Science SARU's approach to social issues combines **grounded, authentic environmental detail with expressive artistic flourishes**. Backgrounds provide lived-in authenticity through accumulated detail suggesting real daily life, while character animation and color shifts visualize internal emotional states.

The studio's multicultural staff brings sensitivity to depicting diverse communities. Their work shows **energetic vibrancy maintaining brightness even in difficult moments**—avoiding exploitation while honoring struggle's reality. Environmental storytelling reveals character history without exposition through temporal layering (architectural styles showing history), cultural indicators, functional spaces showing actual use, and scale creating relationship between individual and environment.

**For Ramadan beggar context**: Show accumulation of daily life detail (worn prayer mats, food stalls preparing iftar, mosque architecture in background), time-of-day progression through color temperature shifts (warm golden hour for hopeful moments, cool twilight for loneliness), character design simplified enough for consistency yet expressive enough for emotional range, crowd scenes with silhouetted figures showing community while emphasizing protagonist's isolation.

**For AI prompts**: "Social realism with artistic expressiveness, lived-in environmental detail showing daily life, desaturated color palette with warm golden accents, simplified character design maintaining emotional expressiveness, muted earth tones with vibrant sunset moments, atmospheric depth through color gradation, cultural authenticity in background details, isolated figure against dense crowd silhouettes"
