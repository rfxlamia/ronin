# Extended Variant

> Access extended context window versions of models using the :extended variant.

The `:extended` variant provides access to model versions with extended context windows.

## Usage

Append `:extended` to any model ID:

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet:extended"
}
```

## Details

Extended variants offer larger context windows than the standard model versions, allowing you to process longer inputs and maintain more conversation history.
