# Data Collection

> Learn what data OpenRouter collects and how it's used.

When using AI through OpenRouter, whether via the chat interface or the API, your prompts and responses go through multiple touchpoints. You have control over how your data is handled at each step.

This page is designed to give a practical overview of how your data is handled, stored, and used by OpenRouter. More information is available in the [privacy policy](/privacy) and [terms of service](/terms).

## Within OpenRouter

OpenRouter does not store your prompts or responses, *unless* you have explicitly opted in to prompt logging in your account settings. It's as simple as that.

OpenRouter samples a small number of prompts for categorization to power our reporting and model ranking. If you are not opted in to prompt logging, any categorization of your prompts is stored completely anonymously and never associated with your account or user ID. The categorization is done by model with a zero-data-retention policy.

## Metadata Collection

OpenRouter does store metadata (e.g. number of prompt and completion tokens, latency, etc) for each request. This is used to power our reporting and model ranking, and your [activity feed](/activity).

This metadata does not include the content of your prompts or responses, only information about the request itself.
